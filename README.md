##### Initial commit - Andrew L'Italien
The homepage is created. There is a header that states in the top left, "COVID-19 Tracker." A login button is in the top right corner of the screen. Clicking this button alerts the user that it is not functional.

Below the header are the two primary elements: the location sidebar and the map element. The sidebar has three buttons: a button that will display all locations, one for all hotspot locations, and one for all places that the user has visited. Like the login button, clicking on them sends an alert to the user that they are not functional yet, although they do change to a light red to highlight which button has been pressed most-recently. There is a list under the buttons that has some placeholder location elements. The 3 buttons in the sidebar, once functional, will update this list.

The map element is planned to take advantage of the Google Maps API, but currently has only a placeholder image of the RPI campus.
